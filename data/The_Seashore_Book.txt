Captain Hawes was an old sailor. After fortyyears' service on the high seas he had settled down ashore at Quohaug.[Illustration]Bluff and hearty, and with no end of sea yarns and stories of strangeadventures, and of foreign ports and peoples, he was more interestingto the children than the most fascinating fairy book.His home was a little museum of odds and ends brought from differentfar-away lands, with everything arranged in shipshape order. The biggreen parrot, who could call "Ship ahoy!" "All aboard!" delighted theboy and girl. And the seashells, which gave the murmuring echo of theocean when you put them to your ear. And the curiosities of strangesorts and shapes, from outlandish countries.As their first day was fine and the bay smooth, Captain Hawes tookthe children out for a row in his "sharpey." How delightful it was,skimming so easily over the shining water. The shore, the docks, andthe vessels at the wharves were all so interesting from this view.[Illustration]He told them all about the different craft they passed, the fishermen,the coal barges, the tramp steamers, how they sailed and where theywent to, and now, finding them such good listeners, for the Captainliked to tell about ships and the sea, he launched forth into a generalhistory of things connected with sea life, from the first men, long,long ago, who began poling about on rafts, to the coracle, and thedugout. The dugouts were canoes hollowed out of tree trunks."Down in the South Seas the savages still make them; I've seen themmany a time," he explained; "and of course you've heard of our Indians'birchbark canoes."By and by the use of sails had developed, and boats and ships grewbigger, and now the day of the steamboat had come."Now, I want you to know all about boats and ships," he added; "I'lltake you to the yards to-morrow, if it's fine, and show you how theymake them, so that when you go back home, where they don't know muchabout such things, you can just tell them."[Illustration]                             THE SHIPYARDThe next day Captain Ben, true to his promise, took the children aroundto Stewart's Boat Shop where a fishing-boat was being built, and showedthem just how the frame was made, the keel, the ribs, the stem, andsternpost, and how the planking was laid on. How everything was made asstiff and strong as possible so that the boat could stand the strain ofbeing tossed about by heavy seas.Bob followed it all with enthusiasm, for he was fond of carpenteringand working with tools. He made up his mind that he would build a boatsome day.And now the Captain, having made everything clear with this smallexample which they could readily understand, proposed a visit to theshipyard, where a real life-sized ship was being built.Here they found a busy gang of men hard at work, some with "broad axes"cutting down the planks to a line, "scoring" and "beating off"; otherswith "adzes" "dubbing," and even whipsawyers ripping logs.[Illustration]On stagings about the great ship, which towered up as high as a house,more men were at work planking. The planks, hot from the steam boxes,carried up the "brow" staging on men's shoulders, to be clamped intoplace and bolted fast.[Illustration]And how big it all was! This made the children open their eyes inwonder. They had already seen such vessels in the water, but had neverappreciated how huge the hulls were, almost like a block of houses, orso it seemed to them.Captain Hawes then showed them how this great ship was built on thesame principle as the small boat they had just seen. And now if thechildren didn't really understand everything it wasn't the Captain'sfault; the subject was rather a big one for beginners. But it was agreat sight, and it wasn't everybody who had seen a ship being built,they knew that.On the way home they rowed past sloops with a strange contrivanceout on the end of the bowsprit; this Captain Hawes said was called a"pulpit." These boats went sword-fishing, and in the pulpit a man wasstationed with lance in hand, while aloft in the rigging a "lookout"sighted the fish. When the boat was near enough, the man with the lancestood ready, and speared the fish as it passed. He promised to showthem these big fish the next time a catch was brought in.[Illustration]                             DIGGING CLAMSThough there were so many interesting things to see and learn by theseashore, it was also an ideal place for play, and just now it seemedto our boy and girl as though nothing else could compare with it.Clam-digging was such sport. Captain Hawes took them down at low tideto the soft mud and showed them how to dig the clams. And then the funof roasting them in the driftwood fire, and the picnic clam-bakes, withthe delicious chowder!It was here the children met a future playmate, Patsey Quinn. CaptainHawes jokingly called him a little water-rat, for Patsey had beenbrought up along the shore and knew all about things. He proved to be amost valuable companion to Bob and Betty, and the Captain could trusthim to look after them, for of course he knew just what was safe andwhat wasn't.[Illustration][Illustration]He took them on many expeditions along the beach, knew just where thebest clams and mussels were to be found, and where the crabs lived,and how to catch them. Wading among the seaweed-covered rocks they hadlively times, occasionally getting their toes or fingers nipped, forcrabs object to being caught.Patsey taught his new friends how to fish, though they never got to beas good fishermen as he was. They seemed to catch more sculpins thananything else, and though sculpins were wonderful looking creaturesthey were not, Patsey explained, very good eating; flounders and eelswere better. But Betty was afraid of eels. They squirmed so.The seaweeds and shells interested the children, and the many-coloredpebbles, so nice and round, from being rolled by the sea, Patseyknowingly explained.He showed them how to throw flat stones along the surface of the water,until they, too, could make them skip a number of times before sinking.There was no end to the variety of amusements; every day seemed tobring forth new ones, and the sunburned, healthy children enjoyed itall to the full.[Illustration]                             THE SAIL LOFTNights, especially dark nights, the children watched with unfailinginterest the great flash-light from the lighthouse out on the point.Captain Hawes had explained the uses of lighthouses, how they showedthe way to ships at night, like signs on street corners or crossroads,and also warned them to keep away from the rocks. One day he rowed themout, and the light-keeper took them up in the tower and proudly showedthem the powerful lamp with its complicated reflectors, and explainedit all. Betty admired the bright, shining appearance of things, and wassurprised to learn that the man himself looked after all this: she hadthought that only a housekeeper could keep up such a polish.[Illustration]Another time Captain Hawes took the children to Barry's sail loft,where the sails for the new ship were being made. He had already toldthem something about sailmaking, but knew they would understand betterby seeing the real things. The sail loft, like everything connectedwith ships, proved interesting,--the broad clean floor, the men ontheir low benches sewing the seams of the heavy canvas, forcing theneedles through with the stout leather "palms," instead of thimbles.And all their neat tools, the "heavers," "stickers," "fids," "grummetstamps," and such odd-named things.[Illustration]On the wall in one corner of the loft was a varied collection of bright"clew irons" and "rings," "thimbles" and "cringles," which aroused thechildren's curiosity. These, it was explained, were to be sewed intothe corners of the sails to hold the ropes for rigging. Here and therecompact, heavy rolls of canvas, sails completed, were lying by, readyto be taken away and rigged to the tall masts and broad yards of theship; sails which later would look so light and graceful when carryingthe ship along.The summer days were passing quickly to the children, and Captain Hawesinsisted that they must hurry and learn to swim, and with Patsey's helpthey were at it daily. After the first cautious wadings and splashingthey enjoyed it immensely, and before the summer was really overthey had learned to keep their heads above water: not to swim far,that would come with time and greater strength, but they had made abeginning, and felt justly proud of the accomplishment.[Illustration]                             THE LOG BOOMThe two children, under the Captain's instruction, learned to row,after a fashion, though the oars of the sharpey were rather heavyfor them, and sometimes would catch in the water with disconcertingresults. The Captain called it "catching a crab." But it was all greatfun, in spite of this.Often Captain Hawes took them sailing in his catboat, the Mary Ann, andone day ran up close to the log "boom" which belonged to the shipyard,and showed them where the lumber came from, for the building of theship. He explained how it had been cut far up in the back forests andrafted down the rivers to the sea. The great raft was now held in placeby a frame of logs outside the others fastened together with "dogs"and chains. Here the children saw the men picking out the speciallogs they needed, and doing various stunts, paddling and balancingwith boathooks. Some would even paddle off to the shipyard on a log,balancing much like a tight-rope walker. But once in a while accidentswould happen, and they would get more than wet feet, to the great gleeof their comrades.[Illustration][Illustration]When the logs reached the shipyard they were sawed into planks by the"whipsawyers," or the machine saws, cut into shape, as they had alreadyseen, by axes and adzes, and fitted to their places in the building ofthe ship.You may be sure the children had to try this game of logging, andthey built themselves a raft, of loose boards lying along the beach,and while Betty was the passenger Bob vigorously poled his raft aboutin the shallows. Patsey Quinn, more ambitious, and used to frequentwettings, boldly imitated the log-men in their balancing feats, notwithout coming to grief occasionally, though it worried him but little;being in the water to him was much the same as being out of it.These were busy, happy days for the children; there was always plentyto see or do. Patsey was curious to know about the things of the city,but Bob and Betty felt perfectly sure, at least just now, that theseashore was a much more interesting place.[Illustration]                             THE LAUNCHINGThe children were always hearing about lobster fishing, for that wasan important industry at Quohaug, so Captain Hawes took them out inhis boat to see the fishermen at work hauling in their traps. Thefishing-beds were dotted with little buoys, each fisherman having hisown, with his private mark. To each buoy a trap was attached by a longline. Down on the bottom the lobsters would crawl into the traps afterthe bait, and then could not get out.But Bob and Betty were disappointed to find these lobsters as they cameout of the water a dull green instead of the beautiful bright red theyexpected. Captain Hawes explained that they would come out red afterthey were boiled.To-day was the day set for the launching of one of the new ships thechildren had seen almost finished in the shipyard on their first visit.High tide was the time set, and the whole village turned out to see theevent. Captain Hawes had told them that they would soon see the shipfloating out in the bay; but this was hard to believe; how would it bepossible to move that big mass? "Just you wait and you'll see," theCaptain assured them.[Illustration][Illustration]At the yard everybody was eager and excited. Captain Hawes put thechildren up on a tall wooden "horse" where they could get a good view.The ship, all decked with gay, fluttering flags, had been wedged intoher "cradle." The ways down which she was to slide were well greased,and the builder was waiting for the tide to be at its highest.At last the moment had come. The signal was given. Busy workmen withsledges, under the ship struck blow on blow, setting up the liftingwedges, and knocking away the few remaining props; then scampered backout of danger.Slowly at first, the great ship "came to life," then began to move.Slowly but steadily gaining speed, she began to slide down the ways.Fast and faster, gaining momentum, she rushed, as though reallyalive, gracefully sliding, into the sea. Then sped far out into thedeep water, where she floated on an even keel. From being a mass ofplanks and beams she now seemed to be a great living creature, andthe lookers-on cheered her and waved their hats, as she proudly tookher place on the sea, where she would pass the rest of her life. Boband Betty were so impressed that even the yacht race they saw thatafternoon, though a fine sight, seemed tame after the launching.[Illustration]                               THE WRECKTo the children the restless sea with its many changes was a new sight.One day it would be flat and calm and shiny, like a big mirror. Againquickly changing with a breeze to blues of various shades. Again itwould be broken with white-caps and spray, as the wind grew stronger.And it was so big! And Captain Hawes assured them that it was evenbigger than it looked, telling them that if they went away out there tothe distant edge by the sky, they would still see another just as faroff, and so on for many, many days before they would get to the otherside of the ocean.When the winds blew high and the waves dashed against the rocks andtossed up the white spray, he would take them down to the beach towatch the storm, and see the surf roll in. Of course this was a timefor rubber boots, "oilskins," and "sou'westers," such as the seafaringpeople wear.[Illustration]One day during a gale, a "nor'easter," when they could hardly standalone, they saw a schooner wrecked out on the rocks. Everybody onshore was greatly excited. And the life-boat with its hardy crewput off to the rescue of the sailors, who could be seen clinging tothe rigging, waiting for help. They were all saved, but the vessel waslost, and dashed high up against the rocks.[Illustration]A few days later, when the storm had passed and the sea became calmagain, Captain Hawes rowed the children out to the rocky point to seethe wreck. Here the stranded schooner lay firmly wedged among therocks. Her masts were gone, her back was broken, and her bow splinteredin pieces, rigging and tatters of sails hung about in confusion. Andthe good craft, which such a short time before had been sailing soproudly, was now but a worthless hulk.Such was often the end of a good many stout vessels, the Captain toldthe children; this was the chance of the sea. And then, once started,he told them long and thrilling tales of his different voyages andadventures, and the wrecks he had known, and been in.[Illustration]                              THE RIGGERSThis life by the sea made an endless appeal to the children'simagination, and offered a never-failing amount of wonderful things tosee and learn about."Now," said Captain Hawes one day, "we'll go over to the wharf and seethe riggers fitting up the new ship we saw launched."You may be sure the children were willing. Captain Hawes, who kneweverybody and was welcome everywhere, took them on board and showedthem everything, from the bow to the stern. And all about the ship wasso neat and well made it was a constant marvel to the children. High upin the rigging men were swarming, "reeving" on "stays" and "shrouds,"and no end of "running" rigging, doing the most wonderful circus stuntsin the most matter-of-fact way, far up on dizzy heights. The childrenfairly held their breath to watch them.[Illustration]Out on the yards sailors were "bending on" the new sails, the sailsBob and Betty had seen being made at the sail loft. The whole workseemed to them a wonderful confusion of lines and ropes and pulleys andtackle. Captain Hawes tried to explain what each rope meant and how itwas used. But there were too many; it was all too confusing. Eachrope, he told them, had its own name; every sailor had to know them tobe able to do his work.[Illustration]The riggers built trim little rope ladders from the rail to thecrosstrees by lashing small "ratlines" to the heavy "shrouds." The"stays" and "shrouds," of course, were to hold the great mastsin place. The children wondered at it all, but didn't pretend tounderstand it, though Bob was especially interested, for climbing heunderstood, and such climbing was far ahead of anything the biggest boyin his school could do.They delighted in the cook's kitchen, the "galley." Such a compact,neat little room, where the most ingenious shelves and lockers werearranged, in which to hold everything needed in the way of dishes andpots and pans. The stove was chained down solidly so that no stormmight upset it and cause fire, the cook explained.To Betty, the "galley" was the most interesting thing about the ship;it pleased her housekeeping instincts, though it did seem strange tosee a sailor cook.[Illustration]                                WHALINGThe city children never wearied of Captain Hawes's stories of hisvoyages, and the Captain, with such good listeners, never weariedtelling of them,--a perfect combination.He told of how when a young man he used to go whaling. "Of course youknow what whales are, big sea animals, you couldn't call them fish,often sixty or seventy feet long, 'as long as a big house,' hugecreatures who lived in the northern or southern seas, though once in awhile a stray one had been known to come into the Sound, not far fromhere."Now the children were really excited. "Oh, if only one should happen tocome this summer!" The Captain said that would be just a chance; it washardly a thing you could count on.[Illustration]When the ship reached the far-away seas where whales were to be found,"lookouts" were stationed aloft at the masthead to watch for them.When one was sighted the lookout shouted, "There she blows"; for thewhales have a habit of blowing up spray when they come to the surfaceto breathe, then the boats were lowered and away the sailors wentafter the whale. When they came up with him they rowed as close as theydared, and the harpooner in the bow of the boat hurled his harpoon intothe big creature's side.[Illustration]The whale at once made a great commotion, slashing about and beatingup the water, then diving deep down. The sailors "paid out" the ropeattached to the harpoon as the whale went down. Sometimes they had tocut it to keep from being dragged under. But when this didn't happenthe whale would come up after a while and start away dragging the boatalong at a terrific speed. In time he would get tired and the boatwould again be rowed near, and a lance thrust into his side until hewas quite dead.It was all exciting and dangerous work, for sometimes the whale wouldattack the boat and splinter it to pieces with a blow of his tail, andthe men, often badly hurt, be thrown into the sea, and sometimes lost.The dead whale was towed off to the ship, here he was moored to theside, and the body cut up. The great pieces of fat blubber "tried out,"that is, melted in pots over the fire on the deck, and the oil run offinto barrels and stowed away in the hold.[Illustration]                           LOADING THE SHIPCaptain Hawes made the children a little toy schooner which theysailed in the coves along the beach. He showed them just how to "trim"the sails and set the rudder, so that the boat would "tack" and sailagainst the wind, "on the wind," he called it.About this time they heard that the new ship, now all rigged and withall sails in place, had been taken to the neighboring port and wastaking on her cargo for a long voyage. As they wanted to see the shipagain, the Captain took them on this little journey to see the workbeing done at the docks.Loading a ship is always a strenuous and hurly-burly affair, with muchbustle, shouting, hauling, pushing, and pulling. The children, underPatsey's lead, found a good point of vantage on top of some boxes, andwatched the work.[Illustration]Busy "stevedores," who had charge, were hurrying the "longshoremen,"who rolled barrels, and carried bags up the gangplank into the ship, tobe snugly stowed away between decks. Bales and boxes were being hoistedover the rail, to be lowered through the hatches into the hold. Thedonkey engine buzzed, the mate shouted orders, and everything, tothe children, seemed confusion, but it was orderly confusion, for thework was rapidly going ahead. The great quantity of goods which wentaboard astonished Bob and Betty; they had never seen so many boxes,barrels, bales, and bags before. And yet this was only the beginning,for the Captain told them that even at this rate it would still takemany days to load the ship.[Illustration]When the first of the cargo went aboard, the vessel sat high out ofthe water, but when all should be in and stowed safely away, shewould settle deep down to her "water line." This was where the greenand black paint met. All this had been planned before she was built,Captain Hawes explained; the ship designer knew just how she should sitin the water when loaded; there was no guesswork about it.The ship was to go on an Eastern voyage. He had often been out there,away off in the China seas, where strange craft came about you: junkswith their odd, high sails, their yellow sailors with "pigtails" downtheir backs, everything so different from our part of the world.[Illustration]                             BURNED AT SEAIn the evenings, as Captain Hawes sat smoking his pipe, he would tellthe children of strange lands he had visited in his voyages, and thensuggest that they look up these places in their geographies, and thisstudy, which before was a task, took on a new interest for Bob andBetty. China and Greenland now meant so much more.Telling about Iceland and Greenland, he said that up there in thoseparts, where almost everything that wasn't snow was ice, certainanimals lived which couldn't be found anywhere else, like the big whitepolar bear, and the walrus."Why, we know a polar bear," Betty broke in. Why, of course, he was anold acquaintance. They had often seen him in Central Park."Well, now, that's good," said the Captain; "now you'll remember wherehe came from. I've been up his way more than once."Often whalers chased the "right" whale away up there; dangerous seas towork in, as icebergs were plenty and the risk of striking them in thefog was great.[Illustration][Illustration]But the thing which sailors dreaded most was fire at sea. This seldomhappened, but when it did it was bad. Once his ship was burned at nightamong the icebergs. There was nothing to do but take to the boats andescape to shore, which luckily was near. They lost everything but theclothes they wore, and a small amount of provisions. And there, whilethey looked on, the ship went up in a sheet of flame, and that wasthe last of her. The Captain said they felt pretty blue and lonelyout there far away from the rest of the world, with no means to getaway but the small boats. Fortunately they soon managed to reach anEskimo village. These Eskimos are the natives who live there always,short people, dressed all in heavy, warm furs, who build themselvessnow houses, where in the coldest weather they keep comfortably warm.They live by hunting and fishing. They spear seals from their skincanoes,--"kayaks,"--and fish through holes in the ice. These are thepeople you hear the explorers tell about when they go on expeditions tothe North Pole. Captain Hawes thought they were the strangest people hehad ever met. As whalers often put in up in these parts, the Captainand his mates did not have too hard a time, and were picked up by apassing ship and brought home.[Illustration]                          THE SHIP SAILS AWAYSummer was passing quickly now, and it would soon be time for the "longvacation" to come to an end.Before they had to go the Sachem--that was the name of the newship--was ready to put to sea. The children had admired her"figure-head," an Indian chief, gilded and painted in bright colors.The ship had taken on her whole cargo, the hatches were closed, andeverything made tight and taut for her long voyage. She was bound forthe Far East, the Captain told them. First she would touch at someSouth American ports, then go across the ocean to Africa, stopping atCape Town, and other less important ports, then around the Cape andup the Indian Ocean to India; then to China and Japan. With the goodsshe had taken aboard she would trade with the different ports, eitherselling or exchanging what she had for the things made or raised inthose far-away countries, which she would bring back home to sell inour markets. This was the way, Captain Hawes explained, that we gotmany good things that we couldn't raise in our own country.[Illustration]The day the ship sailed, everybody turned out to wish her a goodvoyage.[Illustration]With all sails set she was a beautiful sight; a gentle land breezefilled her sails and slowly and gracefully she drew away, headed forthe open sea. The steamers and the tugs in the bay whistled salutes.Captain Hawes, with a sigh, told the children that probably that wasthe last square-rigged ship they were likely to see leaving thisport, as the old-style ship was now almost a thing of the past. The"fore-and-aft" rig was more practical and generally used where sailingvessels were still employed. But even they were all giving way beforesteam. Nowadays steamers, freighters, did nearly all the carrying trade.They watched the ship till far, far away, as the sun was setting, sheshowed as a small black spot on the horizon.And now it was time to leave Quohaug, for this summer vacation wasended. At home again they were just in time to see the review of thecountry's war fleet on the Hudson. This was the latest developmentof sea power, great, massive steel vessels, with no sails, driven bysteam. They were grandly impressive, but just wait till you hear Boband Betty tell of Quohaug and then you will know what ships with sailsmean.[Illustration][Illustration]
